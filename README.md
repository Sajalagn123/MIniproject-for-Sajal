# MIniproject-for-Sajal

## Description
For this project I was taskd with creating a landing page where I had to include a contact form, an image, and a header with a title and a nav bar.


## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
