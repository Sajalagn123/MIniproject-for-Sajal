# MIniproject-for-Sajal

## Description
For this project I was taskd with creating a landing page where I had to include a contact form, an image, and a header with a title and a nav bar.

So far I have added a header and footer with an aquamarine background. I also included in the header a title for the page and a nav bar which has not been styled with inline CSS. I also have been styled the image a bit and added a caption as well. There is a contact form included, asking for email, phone number, and social security, along with a send button. Lastly, the footer has a caption written at the bottom.

I had the nav bar display inline. Also I moved the nav elements to the left and centered them. I have also added input elements to the contact section of the page. 

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
